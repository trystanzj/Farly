=head1 NAME

Farly::ASA::Generator - Create Farly::Objects from the AST

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Farly::ASA::Generator walks a Farly abstract syntax tree searching for Token
value objects. Token objects are recognized by the presence
of the '__VALUE__' key.

When a Token value object is found the AST node class is used as the 
Farly::Object key. The key and value object, from $node->{__VALUE__},
are then set in the new Farly::Object.

The new Farly::Object is stored in the container after the AST
has been explored.

Farly::ASA::Generator dies on error.

Farly::ASA::Generator is used by the Farly::ASA::Builder only.
