Firewall Analysis and Rewrite LibrarY

About
=====

Farly is a firewall rule analysis library.

Farly translates a vendor specific firewall configuration
into an easily searchable vendor independent firewall model.

Using the Farly firewall model, Perl script based firewall 
management tools can be written to perform tasks such as 
firewall security audits, group or rule optimizations or
large scale firewall configuration changes.
